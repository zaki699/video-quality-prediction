## Model Training

Regularization

We apply both L1 (Lasso) and L2 (Ridge) regularization to avoid overfitting and improve model generalization.

	- Lasso (L1) is used for feature selection by penalizing the absolute values of coefficients.
	- Ridge (L2) penalizes large coefficients and helps when features are highly collinear.

Ensemble Methods

We combine predictions from various models using ensemble techniques:

	- XGBoost and LightGBM are gradient boosting models known for their speed and performance.
	- Stacking Regressor: Combines Ridge, Lasso, and XGBoost models to leverage the strengths of each.

Feature Engineering

	- Polynomial features are used to capture interactions between different metrics like motion and edge detection complexity.
	- Feature scaling ensures that models like Ridge and Lasso are not biased towards features with larger scales.

## Evaluation

The models are evaluated using Mean Squared Error (MSE):

	- SSIM MSE
	- PSNR MSE
	- VMAF MSE

Additionally, the final stacking modelâ€™s performance is evaluated and printed.

Feature Importance

XGBoost is used to compute feature importance scores, which help in understanding which features are most significant for predicting video quality.

Example plot for SSIM feature importance:

```bash
plot_feature_importance(xgb_model_ssim.feature_importances_, X.columns, 'XGBoost SSIM')
```

Hyperparameter Tuning

Grid search is performed to optimize hyperparameters such as learning rate, depth of trees, and number of estimators for XGBoost.

```python
param_grid = {
    'learning_rate': [0.01, 0.1, 0.2],
    'max_depth': [3, 5, 7],
    'n_estimators': [50, 100, 200]
}
```

Cross-Validation

Cross-validation is used to evaluate the generalization of the model using different folds of the data.

```python
cv_scores = cross_val_score(ridge_ssim, X_train_scaled, y_ssim_train, cv=5, scoring='neg_mean_squared_error')
print(f"Cross-validation MSE scores: {-cv_scores.mean()}")
```
